# Reddit to Google Drive
Bulk download Reddit posts and upload to a Google Drive folder.
This program uses [PyDrive](https://pypi.org/project/PyDrive/) and [praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)

## Setup
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The new and improved version only needs ~10 MB of free space! ðŸŽ‰

## Use
Open `parent.txt` and modify it to your preferences. Here's the format:
```
Parent_ID
``` 

### Parent ID:
Drive folder ID of where the files should be put. This is the ID of a folder:

If you want it in your `My Drive`, put `root` here.

Here's an example of a good `parent.txt` file:
```

```

Now, go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a new project.

I'm using a throwaway email so there's no need to try to email me.

When it asks you for scopes, just ignore it and click continue.

In OAuth Client ID, pick these settings:

Now, download the JSON. It will be named something really long. Just change that to `client_secrets.json` and move it to H:\

Now, go to `settings.yaml` and change the client_id to your client id and the client_secret to your client secret (both are in `client_secrets.json`)

### Subreddit:
Which sub to get posts from. Do not include the `r/`, only include the name. For instance, `pics`

If left unspecified, it will get posts from all the subreddits you are in.

### Post Amount:
How many posts to get. Cannot be over 1000 due to api limitations.

### Keep Posts:
If you don't want to delete the images after uploading them, pass `-k` to the main file.

Wait for it to finish downloading. Once it finishes, it will prompt you to log in. Just select the account where you want the files to be uploaded and allow access. Then, it will upload. 

Here's an example of a valid command to download 100 trending memes:

```
python3 main.py -s memes -n 100
```
